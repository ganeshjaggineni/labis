Given:
Plaintext (64-bit): 675A69675E5A6B5A
Key (64-bit): 5B5A57676A56676E

Derive the first-round subkey, K1:
The first step in DES key scheduling is the permutation choice 1 (PC-1). PC-1 takes the 64-bit key and reduces it to 56 bits by permuting it according to a predefined table.

The PC-1 table looks like this:

python
Copy code
57  49  41  33  25  17  9
1   58  50  42  34  26  18
10  2   59  51  43  35  27
19  11  3   60  52  44  36
...
After applying PC-1, we split the 56-bit result into two 28-bit halves, C0 and D0.

Now, we perform left circular shifts on C0 and D0. In the first round of DES, both halves are shifted by one bit.

After shifting, we apply permutation choice 2 (PC-2). PC-2 reduces the 56-bit halves to 48 bits by selecting specific bits from the concatenated halves.

Finally, we obtain the first-round subkey K1, which is 48 bits long.

Let's perform the calculations:

Derive left and right parts of the plaintext, Lo, Ro:
Given plaintext (64-bit): 675A69675E5A6B5A
Lo (left part): 675A6967 (32-bit)
Ro (right part): 5E5A6B5A (32-bit)

Expand Ro to get E[Ro]:
The expansion function (E) expands the 32-bit right part (Ro) to 48 bits by duplicating certain bits from Ro. The expansion is done according to the following table:

python
Copy code
32  1   2   3   4   5
4   5   6   7   8   9
8   9   10  11  12  13
12  13  14  15  16  17
...
After expanding Ro, we get E[Ro] (48 bits).

Calculate A = E[Ro] XOR K1:
