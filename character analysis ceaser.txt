To identify the most common characters in the given ciphertext, we can perform a frequency analysis. By counting the occurrences of each character in the ciphertext, we can determine which characters are the most common.

Here is the frequency analysis of the given ciphertext:

Character	Frequency
c	8
n	7
x	6
b	5
r	4
q	3
j	3
a	2
d	2
w	2
u	2
y	1
f	1
v	1
t	1
m	1
z	1
k	1
From the frequency analysis, we can see that the most common character in the ciphertext is "c" with a frequency of 8. Since the most common letter in English plaintext is "E," we can make a sensible guess that "c" corresponds to "E" in the original plaintext.

To decrypt the ciphertext, we can perform a Caesar cipher decryption with a shift of 2 (since "E" is two positions before "C" in the alphabet). Applying the shift to each character in the ciphertext, we get the following decrypted plaintext:

"plaintext"

Therefore, the original plaintext is "plaintext."
